A-windows-Phone-Store-App-Checks-Eye-Problem
============================================
Kontrast is the App name.
A app which can say about your eye capability and eye problems.

I want tomake it universal App both in windows phone as well as windows store App by using windows 2013 or above.

Basically in this app there will be some stages to check your eye capability.First level will be simple which will give you some 
blocks  and you have to find lighter block ,like that.

Next stage: This will be colour blindness test ,I want to add here 5 types of test named :
          1.Ishihara Test:
                          In this test it will also say about types of color blindness for more info check this :

          2.Color Arrangement Test for Color Blindness.

 We can add some links for other types of eye problem if the user is facing.User will click that link and he will get  more information
 about that eye disease.
 
It will also say about diagnosis separatly for each type of colour blindness and other eye problems.
